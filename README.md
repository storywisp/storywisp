- 👋 Hello, my name is @storywisp, I’m from Brisbane city, Australia. I like writing, and I love storytelling. Whether they’re loose as you like filled with fantasy and worldplay; or uniquely crafted through stacks of code, there are just infinite incredible stories to tell.
- 👀 I’m interested in creating webspaces designed to dazzle and delight.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics, 2022s' language of the year is code; namely HTML, CSS, and JAVA.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on business ideas! Coding can definitely land you a sweet gig but imagine igniting your own agency; or even a sweet lil side-hustle? ;)
